      <h2>About Mickey</h2>
      <p> First, I want to say how excited I am to be learning the skill of web development. Part of my job in the Navy was layout and design of all sorts of print materials, from posters to pamphlets, and I'm positive that my passion for design will carry over into the digital world. </p>
      <p> I often had to collaborate with other Sailors on projects, and I imagine it will be the same way when working on websites. I'm confertable being the leader as well as being led, and I can't wait be a part of a succesful team. </p>

      <p> Outside of web development, you can often find me:</p>
